##MTG API Rate Limits

###Overview
```
Rate limits are enforced for all third-party applications and services. 
This document is an overview of the rate limits themselves, as well as how they are enforced and 
best practices for handling the errors returned when a rate limit is reached.

Third-party applications are currently throttled to 5000 requests per hour. 
As this API continues to age, the rate limits may be updated to provide better performance to users
